This is a Portfolio Project I did for my Carrer Path at Codecademy in Data Science.

The project consist of using what we have learnt so far in Python to analyze historical medical insurance cost data in the USA.

I used Visual Code with Jupyter Notes extensions to make this project. Any reviews, suggestions or corrections, please let me know.
